## üö® Current Issues and Blockers

### Issue 1: Supabase Storage MIME Type Restrictions
**Status**: Blocking all file uploads
**Impact**: Cannot upload project files to Supabase storage
**Root Cause**: Supabase storage buckets have restrictive MIME type policies
**Attempts Made**:
- Created buckets with `allowedMimeTypes: ['*']`
- Updated bucket policies multiple times
- Tried multiple content type strategies
- Implemented retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

**Error Pattern**: `mime type application/json is not supported`, `mime type text/markdown is not supported`

### Issue 2: Alternative Upload Strategies
**Status**: All strategies failing
**Attempts Made**:
- Multiple content type fallbacks
- Generic content type (`application/octet-stream`)
- No content type specification
- Delayed retry mechanisms
